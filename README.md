# Pneumonia-Detection-using-chest-x-ray-images
**Summary of the Pneumonia Detection Model Using VGG16**
This model is designed to assist healthcare professionals by accurately classifying chest X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia, leveraging the power of deep learning and transfer learning using the pre-trained VGG16 model. It serves as a diagnostic assistant, providing quick and reliable results, thereby aiding radiologists and doctors in making informed medical decisions. 

**Acuracy: 90.89%**

**How the Model Works**

**Architecture and Design:**
The model uses the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
The top (fully connected) layers are excluded, allowing the model to learn pneumonia-specific features.
A custom classifier is added, comprising:
A Flatten layer to convert the convolutional feature maps into a 1D array.
A Dense layer with a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

**Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning:**
All layers of VGG16 are frozen to leverage pre-learned features from ImageNet while preventing overfitting on the relatively smaller chest X-ray dataset.
Only the newly added classifier layers are trained.

**Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:**
Image Rescaling: Pixel values are normalized by scaling them to the range [0, 1].
Data Augmentation: Techniques like shear, zoom, and horizontal flipping are used to increase data diversity and improve model robustness.

**Model Compilation and Training:**
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate suitable for transfer learning.
Categorical Cross-Entropy is used as the loss function since it is a multi-class classification problem.
Accuracy is used as the performance metric.
The model is trained for one epoch, with both training and validation steps calculated dynamically.

Prediction and Diagnostic Assistance:
The model classifies chest X-ray images into categories such as 'Normal' or 'Pneumonia' with associated confidence scores.
A custom function is implemented to:
1) Display the input X-ray image.
2) Predict the class label with a confidence threshold.
3) Mark inputs as "Invalid" if the confidence is below a defined threshold (e.g., 70%), reducing the risk of misdiagnosis due to uncertain predictions.
The model serves as a diagnostic assistant, aiding radiologists by providing a second opinion and helping prioritize patient cases based on severity.

**Deployment:**
The trained model is saved in .keras format for future reusability.
It is converted to TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) for deployment on mobile or edge devices, enabling rapid and offline diagnostics in clinical settings.

**Required Environment and Dependencies**
To run this model, the following environment and dependencies are required:

1) Programming Language: Python (preferably version 3.7 or higher)
2) Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow (2.x version) and Keras
3) Additional Libraries:
   a) NumPy for numerical operations
   b) Matplotlib for image visualization
   c) glob for file path management
4) Hardware Requirements:
   a) GPU acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPU) for faster training and inference.
      Alternatively, a high-performance CPU can be used but will be slower.

**Role as a Diagnostic Assistant**
This model acts as a powerful diagnostic assistant by:

1) **Improving Diagnostic Accuracy**: Reduces human error by providing consistent and reliable results, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
2) **Speeding Up Diagnosis:** Speeds up the diagnostic process, enabling doctors to focus on complex cases and improving patient throughput.
3) **Supporting Remote Healthcare**: The TFLite version allows deployment on mobile devices, supporting remote diagnostics in under-resourced areas.
4) **Assisting Radiologists:** Offers a second opinion, minimizing biases and ensuring comprehensive analysis.

**Conclusion**
By leveraging the power of transfer learning with VGG16, this model efficiently detects pneumonia from chest X-rays, acting as a robust diagnostic assistant. Its deployment on mobile and edge devices ensures accessibility and rapid diagnostics, especially in remote healthcare settings. This tool not only aids radiologists and healthcare professionals but also enhances patient care through timely and accurate medical decisions.
